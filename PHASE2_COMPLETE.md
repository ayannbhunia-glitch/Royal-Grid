# ‚úÖ Phase 2 Complete - Multiplayer Waiting Room & Bot Auto-fill

## üéâ What's Working Now

### 1. Manual Start with Waiting Room ‚úÖ
- **No auto-start**: Game waits in lobby until host clicks "Start Game"
- **Minimum 2 players required**: Start button disabled until 2+ players join
- **Host-only control**: Only game creator can start the game
- **Real-time player list**: Shows all joined players with names
- **Empty slot visualization**: Dashed borders for waiting slots
- **Bot fill indication**: Shows message about remaining slots being filled with bots

### 2. Share & Invite System ‚úÖ
- **Share code display**: Shows 8-character code in waiting room
- **Copyable invite link**: Full URL with share code
- **Copy button**: One-click copy to clipboard
- **Auto-join from URL**: Paste link in browser to auto-join game

### 3. Bot Auto-fill on Start ‚úÖ
- **Smart player counting**: Counts human players vs total slots
- **Bot creation**: Remaining slots filled with CPU players
- **Player type marking**: `type: 'human'` or `type: 'cpu'`
- **Toast notification**: Shows human/bot split (e.g., "Playing with 2 humans and 2 bots")
- **Bot AI**: Uses existing `useGameEffects` logic for automatic moves

### 4. Game Session Management ‚úÖ
- **Shared context**: `GameSessionProvider` ensures App and Lobby share state
- **Real-time sync**: Supabase Realtime updates all connected clients
- **Leave game**: Players can leave before/during game
- **Reset functionality**: "Back to Lobby" button for error recovery

### 5. Multiplayer Game Board ‚úÖ
- **Grid rendering**: 8x8 (or custom) grid with playing cards
- **Turn indicators**: Shows whose turn it is
- **Player status**: Active/Finished for each player
- **Move history**: Real-time move log
- **Card counter**: Tracks remaining cards by rank
- **Possible moves**: Highlights valid moves for current player
- **Bot auto-play**: CPU players make moves automatically

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Architecture
```
index.tsx
  ‚îú‚îÄ AuthProvider (authentication)
  ‚îú‚îÄ GameSessionProvider (shared game state)
  ‚îî‚îÄ ToasterProvider (notifications)
      ‚îî‚îÄ App
          ‚îú‚îÄ LoginScreen (if not authenticated)
          ‚îú‚îÄ Lobby (if no game)
          ‚îî‚îÄ MultiplayerGameBoard (if game exists)
              ‚îú‚îÄ Waiting Room (if not initialized)
              ‚îî‚îÄ Game Board (if initialized)
```

### Key Components

**lib/game-session-context.tsx**
- Centralized game session state
- Create/join/leave game functions
- Real-time subscription management
- Player count tracking

**components/Lobby.tsx**
- Create game UI (players, grid size)
- Join game UI (share code)
- Auto-join from URL parameter

**components/MultiplayerGameBoard.tsx**
- Waiting room with player list
- Share code and invite link
- Start game button (host only)
- Game grid with cards
- Sidebar with game info

**hooks/useMultiplayerGameState.ts**
- Game state synchronization
- Move submission to Supabase
- Real-time state updates
- Bot player initialization

### Database Schema
```sql
games table:
  - id (uuid)
  - status ('waiting' | 'playing' | 'finished')
  - num_players (2-4)
  - grid_size (4-10)
  - share_code (8 chars)
  - players (jsonb array)
  - game_state (jsonb)
  - created_by (uuid)
  - winner_uid (uuid, nullable)
```

### Real-time Flow
1. Player 1 creates game ‚Üí `status: 'waiting'`
2. Player 2 joins via share code ‚Üí `players` array updated
3. All clients receive real-time update
4. Host clicks "Start Game"
5. `initializeGame()` creates grid with bots
6. `game_state` saved to DB with `players` marked as human/cpu
7. Game begins, moves sync via Supabase

## üêõ Bugs Fixed

### Session State Sharing
- **Problem**: Lobby and App had separate `useGameSession` instances
- **Fix**: Created `GameSessionProvider` context for shared state
- **Result**: App switches to game board when game created/joined

### React Hooks Rules
- **Problem**: `useMemo` called conditionally in waiting room
- **Fix**: Moved all hooks to top-level of component
- **Result**: No "Rendered fewer hooks than expected" error

### Component Prop Mismatches
- **Problem**: Wrong prop names passed to child components
- **Fix**: Aligned props with component interfaces:
  - `MoveHistory`: `history` (not `moveHistory`)
  - `CardCounter`: `initialCounts` (not `initialCardCounts`)
  - `GameInfo`: `currentPlayerId`, `isAiThinking`, `playerCount`
  - `PlayingCard`: `cell`, `isKingHere`, `cardSize`
- **Result**: All components render correctly

### TypeScript Errors
- **Problem**: Supabase RPC doesn't have `.catch()` method
- **Fix**: Use destructured `{ error }` pattern
- **Result**: No TypeScript errors
